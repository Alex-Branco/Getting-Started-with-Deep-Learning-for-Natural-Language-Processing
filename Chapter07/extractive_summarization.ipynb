    "\n",
    "One of the popular algorithm for text summarization is text rank. Text is an extractive and unsupervised techniques for the text summarization. Text rank is inspired by the page rank algorithm. page rank is popularly used in the search engine development like google.  Let's see how page rank works. For Example, we have 5 pages with some hyperlinking between them. The hyperlink is a way to navigate between two pages.  the connectivity of one page is defined as per the number of hyperlinks present between them. for example, let's say we have following hyperlinking in 5 pages\n",
    "\n",
    "The rank of these pages can be defined on the basis of a number of links present in between them using Pagerank algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connectivity between 5 pages can be represented with probabilities and this probability can be easily represented with a matrix of 5*5 as shown below with all the probabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write about matrix generation. The page which is having no connectivity is called a dangling page. here --- is the dangling page. \n",
    "\n",
    "The entire process of the Text rank is can be summarized in the following steps.these step is very similar to the Page rank algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In place of web pages, we use text in the Text rank\n",
    "- The hyperlink between two pages as the connectivity measure is replaced with the sentence similarity in the text rank algorithm.\n",
    "- The matrix is constructed with a similarity between all the sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the single document summarization, the document is tokenized.\n",
    "In the multiple documents, the first step would concatenate all the documents and then tokenize the text.\n",
    "Apply distance measure on the sentence after applying embeddings to the tokens. Using this a similarity matrix is calculated. \n",
    "A weighted graph is constructed. \n",
    "page rank is applied to the constructed graph to form the sentence ranking\n",

       "'Interactions between galaxies are relatively frequent, and they can play an important role in galactic evolution. Near misses between galaxies result in warping distortions due to tidal interactions, and may cause some exchange of gas and dust.[83][84] Collisions occur when two galaxies pass directly through each other and have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars of interacting galaxies will usually not collide, but the gas and dust within the two forms will interact, sometimes triggering star formation. A collision can severely distort the shape of the galaxies, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.[83][84]. At the extreme of interactions are galactic mergers. In this case the relative momentum of the two galaxies is insufficient to allow the galaxies to pass through each other. Instead, they gradually merge to form a single, larger galaxy. Mergers can result in significant changes to morphology, as compared to the original galaxies. If one of the merging galaxies is much more massive than the other merging galaxy then the result is known as cannibalism. The more massive larger galaxy will remain relatively undisturbed by the merger, while the smaller galaxy is torn apart. The Milky Way galaxy is currently in the process of cannibalizing the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy and the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy.[83][84]\\n\\n'"
